# NLP_Sentiment_Network_Analysis_of_Netflix_Tweets
My aim here is to show that the tweets from Twitter about various series will help in analyzing the popularity of series genre by US regions and identify influencers in a network of users interested in same series.

The study of popularity of various category of Netflix series using the data from Twitter. As Twitter has more than one billion users and we find Tweets related to entertainment more than anything else, it is one of the best social media sites to perform this research, also using the Twitter API to retrieve the data is comparatively easy to achieve our goals. Below are the items we are interested to research with the data.
❖	Focus on the Netflix series, which includes series in all categories such as comedy, Action, Drama and Documentary
❖	Do a sentiment analysis based on the feedback of the users through Tweets to understand the popularity of each series
❖	Identify which category of series (Action, Comedy, Drama, Documentary) is most popular in each community separated by US regions East, Northeast, Midwest, West and South.
❖	Find a network among users who tweets about the Netflix serieses we analyze to identify the influencers who contributes to good or bad results of the series
This analysis takes the advantages of both sentiment and network analysis which helps to understand the overall opinion of the series as well as it identifies the influencers in each network which helps the business to target the users to influence positively or address real concerns in the products.
